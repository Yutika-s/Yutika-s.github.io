               My introduction to this book goes something like this: 'When Breath Becomes Air' is a book that will make you cry even if a book has never made you cry before.

                This is the autobiography of the author Paul Kalanithi, a neurosurgeon and writer whose life changes drastically when he is diagnosed with a rare cancer. 
                Through his fine writing, he makes the reader journey through his whole life. His happy childhood, his youth and how he decides to study medical, the hardwork and gruelling hours put into it through his residency in neurosurgery, his human denial of the possibility that he has cancer, to the diagnosis.
                He makes the reader feel every feeling he feels, the tranquility and distress he has all at once, and the acceptance that he reaches after a while.

                This is a book that will teach you the importance of living life while you can, it will teach you not to take anything or anyone for granted, and to really think about what matters to you most. Because knowu=ing when you will die makes hardly any difference at all. Death meets us all sooner or later, what matters is how you live now.
            </p>

                This is a book that I would surely gift to all my friends.
