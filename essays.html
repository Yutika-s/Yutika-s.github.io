                    <p>This is the only book that has made me and many other readers shed tears of a multitude of emotions all at once. Read this book to face your mortality and live fully.</p>
                    <span class="citation">"You seek what life is in death, now find it air that once was Breath."</span> 

                   <p> This is a book written by a doctor, a husband, a writer and a father who loved his daughter dearly. This is a book written by a dying man who saw the whole life he had ahead of him and the life he now didn't.</p>
                    <p>Paul Kalanithi's life, documented in this book walks us through the life of a neurosurgeon who specialises in cancer; a man with tremendous potential. He walks us through his life as he gets diagnosed with cancer himself, and how he lives through it to a good death. Paul's life in a way reflects all of ours. Each one of us has the potential to achieve, each one of us has a deadline, and each one of us is more or less aware of it.</p>
                    <p>Knowing the day you will die would change both everything and nothing for you, and for me while making us realise our value in our mortality.</p>

                <p>With Strength, Determination, and sheer wisdom, she has achieved the impossible! </p> <br> <p> Nah, I'm just kidding. I took a lot of help from my boyfriend, and watched a lot, A LOT of coding gurus on youtube who all collectively said "I know it feels like you'll never be able to do it, but if I can, you cann too!" until I could do nothing but get super-motivated to do it in 6months. Only to say "I can't do this!!!" in 3days.</p>
                <p>Just as all hope seemed lost, I gave it one last shot and played one last coding guru video. That's when it all changed. This guy was <em>different!</em> He said, "You gotta have skin in the game man. You're not going anywhere if you don't have skin in the game. Buy a Course on Udemy. BUY IT. NOW!" Then proceeded to repeat this in 5 different ways. I figured he kinda made sense...Soo I bought it!</p>

                   Ok, not <em>that</em> serious ofc.
                   <br>I started out with my man's suggestion and completed the HarvardxMIT's CS50 on edx taught by David Malan. That is what hooked me in. I started to love programming. 100% Yuts-Certified and recommended.
                </p>
                <p>Then I took things forward with the Udemy Course I bought thanks to my boyfriend and Youtube guru [they're two different people.] Which eventually led me here! To you! Via the Internet!</p>
                <p>Editor's insert: At this point the girl just got super excited about how cool it was. So, she and our journalists had a mini celebration party instead of concluding her story.</p>

                </div>
                <p class="date">29th June 2023</p>
                <p>When was the last time you visited a a real forest--one that was not made of cement and concrete? When was the last time you ran up or climbed a hill? Do you recall the feeling? Do you recall the details? Do you long to go back there?</p><p>

                    Mountains, Forests and Nature in general make humans feel calm, and peaceful. There's quantifying research to this which I will talk about later. The Japanese even have a term for being in the presence of nature -- Shinrin Yoku i.e., the art of Forest Bathing. But this is not why I love mountains. I didn't even know about all this before.
                    
                    I love the mountains because they're wonderous. They inspire awe. Whether you look at them as a whole from afar, stare at the intricacies around you when you're in the forest, or as you stare at the spread of an unending, breath-taking landscape below you as you stand atop them. They never fail to mesmerise you, never fail to offer a sense of calm and optimism in the storms of life. 
                </p><p>
                    Personally, they make me pause and reflect. They make me think and not think at the same time. They make me think of and about the present moment while shutting my brain to all thoughts of the past and the future. 
                </p><p>
                    Nature. She's all around. She talks. Through the rustling leaves, the cold breeze, the chirping birds and the buzzing bees. Through the scent of the flowers and the sights so beautiful, she welcomes me into her presence. She welcomes me to be present. She welcomes me home. 
                </p><p>
                    The mountains are everything from music to my ears to a sight to my eyes. I've always been someone who loves the idea of hiking, trekking up mountains or even trail runs in the woods. I'm a city girl. Not by heart but by where I was born. Never seen a lot of forests, not been away from my house much. Yet so, Nature has always called out to me.
                </p> <p>
                    Before my first ever hike, I would always imagine myself in the woods. I'd picture the view, the feeling, the deep breath filled with the sweet scent of the trees and wildflowers, freedom in the form of a cool breeze hitting my face as i run on a trail in the mountains. The feeling--in imagination--was pure bliss. And I couldn't wait to actually experience it. Nature excites me with all that she offers; and she offers all she has in abundance.

                </figure>
                   <p>
                    My first ever hike was more than just a hike for me. It was a discovery. The discovery of a lush green hill in the middle of the city resulting from a conversation with my closest friend that went a little like this:
                    </p><p>
                    Him: "I was on this hike with my friends and--"
                    
                    Me: "I've never been on a hike before…"
                    
                    Him: "wHAT? *inhales a deep breath of disbelief* I have a place I want to show you."
                </p><p>
                    And there it was, just like that! One of the most exhilarating experiences of my life. It was a wish coming true.
                    
                    I clearly remember the trek up that mountain. It was one of the most special days of my life! Sighting peacocks on the way up, listening to birds chirp, the sweet smell of the early spring forest, a clear blue sky with cotton white clouds and my heart filled with happiness, love, and excitement. 
                </p><p>
                    The view of the sunrise from atop was a sight I could never possibly compare with anything else. I felt blessed to be atop that mountain. I felt fulfilled.
                    
                    Every little life-form on a mountain makes up the entirety of it. The mountain that is in itself alive, breathes life into me. It leaves me refreshed, rejuvenated, glowing. The mountains make me feel calm, rested, peaceful. The sereneity of the forest allows me to be completely in my natural element.

                <p class="date">17th February, 2021</p>
                <p> I tried to understand many times why most people don't understand the gravity of climate change, but once you see it, there's no going back. Therefore, today, I'm going to attempt to explain to how it dawned on me why humans don't understand the severity of the effects of climate change.</p>
                <p>
                    So, Let's picture a frog.
                <figure class="figure">

                </figure>
                Put the frog in hot water. You won't be surprised that it metaphorically yelps, literally croaks, and immidiately jumps out.
                But... Put it in cold water and heat the water; the frog does not realise the change in temperature. 
                Soon it is too late. The frog numbs & dies.
                </p><p>
                But then, what if I told you that this is not true--atleast for frogs.
                Frogs do detect slow temperature changes and jump to safety if it gets uncomfortably hot.
                Humans on the other hand... don't. <br>
                Our ability to detect relative damage caused over a large enough timescale is poor.
                With the way climate change is going, we are the Frog in the story.
